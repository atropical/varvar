# VarVar - Figma Variable Export Plugin

VarVar is a Figma plugin that allows you to export your Figma variables to JSON, CSV or CSS formats, making it easier to integrate your design tokens into your development workflow.

## Features

- Export Figma variables to JSON, CSV or CSS formats
- Identifies linked variables*
   - JSON: linked variables start with `$.VARIABLE.PATH`
   - CSV: linked variables start with `=VARIABLE/PATH`
     - **Option:** *Use row & column positions.* This will produce instead a "formula-like" (i.e. `=E7`) linking in spreadsheet programs.
   - CSS: linked variables will be linked like so `--var-name: var(--VARIABLE)`
- Preview exported data within the plugin interface
- Automatically download exported files

*Note: When dealing with linked variables that have multiple modes, the plugin will only link to the first occurrence (i.e., the first mode).
